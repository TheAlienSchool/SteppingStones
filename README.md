# SteppingStones

A project dedicated to honoring and preserving the cultural moments, voices, and words that serve as stepping stones for humanity's collective journey.

## Purpose

SteppingStones documents and acknowledges the profound contributions to our cultural ecosystem and creative ecology. We believe that certain words, spoken at pivotal moments, become stepping stones that guide future generations.
