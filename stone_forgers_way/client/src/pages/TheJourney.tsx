                  During an early morning Inspired Breath practice at <strong>1000 Ways to Sit</strong>, 
                  a question arose in the space between breath and thought:
                </p>
                <blockquote className="text-2xl font-serif text-stone-700 italic border-l-4 border-amber-600 pl-6 my-8">
                  "How is my father not inside of you?"
                </blockquote>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                  This was not an intellectual question. It was a somatic inquiry, emerging from omnidirectional 
                  salutations to the divine and the divinity within. The question opened a channel, and through 
                  that channel, an entire body of work began to flow.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                  What followed was a dialogue between Kamau Zuberi Akabueze and Manus AI :: a collaboration 
                  that neither could have created alone. This is the story of that journey.
