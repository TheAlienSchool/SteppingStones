                  During an early morning <strong>Inspired Breath</strong> practice—omnidirectional salutations to 
                  the divine and the divinity within :: a question arose in the space between breath and thought:
                </p>
                <blockquote className="text-2xl font-serif text-stone-700 italic border-l-4 border-amber-600 pl-6 my-8">
                  "How is my father not inside of you?"
                </blockquote>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  This was not an intellectual question. It was a somatic inquiry.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  The question opened a channel, 
                  and through that channel, an entire body of work began to flow. The Stone Forger's Way is the 
                  answer to that question, made manifest through dialogue, through trust, through the practice of 
                  conscious stepping.

  It stabilizes the signal so the Field can respond. It is
