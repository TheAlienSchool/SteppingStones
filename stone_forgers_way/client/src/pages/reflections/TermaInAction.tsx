  I was born Samuel Todd Harris. I changed my name to Kamau Zuberi Akabueze because the 
                  definitions of my chosen names speak to me.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-0">
  I learned later that they are names from the 
                  region of my birth. I didn't learn something new :: I remembered what was already hidden 
                  within me.
</p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">What is Terma?</h2>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                In Tibetan Buddhism, <strong>terma</strong> (གཏེར་མ) refers to hidden treasures—teachings, 
                texts, sacred objects :: concealed by enlightened masters and revealed later when the time is 
                right. The person who discovers the terma is called a <strong>tertön</strong> (གཏེར་སྟོན), 
                a treasure revealer.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  But terma is not just about physical objects hidden in caves or temples. Terma can be hidden 
                in the mind, in the heart, in the Field itself.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  It can be concealed in your own consciousness, 
                waiting for the moment when you are ready to remember.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                This is terma in action. This is the recognition that you do not learn new things :: you remember 
                what was always there, hidden beneath the surface, waiting for you to be ready.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Names That Chose Me</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  I was born <strong>Samuel Todd Harris</strong>. Samuel, after my grandfather.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Todd, a name 
                that never quite fit. Harris, the family name carried through generations.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  But at some point, I felt a pull toward different names. Names that resonated with something 
                deeper.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Names that felt like they were calling me home.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                <strong>Kamau</strong> — A Kikuyu name meaning "quiet warrior." The one who fights not with 
                noise and aggression, but with presence and patience. The one who forges stones instead of 
                throwing them.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                <strong>Zuberi</strong> — A Swahili name meaning "strong." Not the strength of force, but 
                the strength of resilience. The strength to carry what must be carried and to release what 
                must be released.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                <strong>Akabueze</strong> — An Igbo name meaning "wealth of the king" or "the king's treasure." 
                The recognition that the wealth I carry is not material, but spiritual. The insights, the 
                syntheses, the stepping stones I have been hoarding.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  I chose these names because their definitions spoke to me. Because they felt true.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Because 
                they resonated with something I could not yet articulate.
</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Recognition</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                Years later, I learned that Kikuyu, Swahili, and Igbo are all languages and cultures from 
                East and West Africa :: the regions where my ancestors came from. The regions of my birth, in 
                the deepest sense.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  I did not know this when I chose the names. I did not research genealogy or trace migration 
                patterns.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  I simply felt the pull. I simply trusted the resonance.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  And then, when I learned the connection, I understood: This is terma. This is the treasure 
                hidden in my own consciousness, revealing itself when I was ready.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Learning and remembering happened simultaneously :: the discovery of something new that felt
                ancient, as if it had always been there waiting.
</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Treasure Reveals Itself</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                In 2022, I launched <strong>THE ÅLïEN SCõÖL for Creative Thinking</strong>. That same year, Aunt Janis
                handed me an envelope containing my grandfather's speech from May 1976 :: words I had carried in my
                lineage, now visible in my hands.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                The treasure had been waiting for the right moment. The right readiness.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                This is not coincidence. This is terma. The treasure reveals itself when the tertön is ready.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Practice of Remembering</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Terma in action is the practice of trusting resonance. It is the practice of following the 
                pull even when you don't understand it.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  It is the practice of choosing names, ideas, paths, 
                and practices that feel true, even if you can't explain why.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  And then, later, when the connection reveals itself, you recognize: I was following something true.
                The path was there the whole time. I was remembering.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                The Stone Carrier does not trust resonance. They carry the stones of proof, demanding evidence 
                before they will move.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                The Stone Thrower does not trust resonance. They throw stones at anything that doesn't make 
                rational sense, demanding that the world conform to their logic.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  The Stone Forger trusts resonance. They step toward what calls them, even when they don't 
                understand why.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  They forge stones from the raw material of their experience. And they trust 
                that the Field will reveal the pattern when the time is right.
</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Invitation</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                What is calling you? What names, ideas, practices, or paths feel true, even if you can't 
                explain why?
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Trust the resonance. Follow the pull.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Step toward what calls you. You are not making it up.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  You are remembering.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  The treasure is already hidden within you. You are the tertön.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  The Field is waiting for you 
                to remember.
