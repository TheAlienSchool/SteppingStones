            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Samuel R. Harris, a coal miner's son who became an organic research chemist, stood before his
              congregation in 1976 and declared: <em>"It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness."</em>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Chadwick Boseman, an artist who embodied giants while silently carrying his own battle,
              left behind a creative philosophy that whispers: <em>"Secrecy is the second stone...
              it is the project's fortress."</em>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              One lit candles. One built fortresses to protect them until they were ready to illuminate the world.

              Same truth. Different expressions.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              These instructions are not foreign to The Stone Forger's Way. They are its echo in another key.
            </p>

                  "Write the vision and make it plain" :: Feel the Stones
                </h3>
                <p className="text-stone-700">
                  Before anything can be forged, it must be felt. The weight must be acknowledged.
                  The vision must move from the abstract to the concrete :: from floating possibility
                  to felt reality. This is the first act of creation. Not performing the vision, but
                  <em>writing it plain</em>. Feeling its mass. Knowing what you carry.
                </p>
              </div>

                  "Shut it in your bolted drawer" :: The Shield
                </h3>
                <p className="text-stone-700">
                  The Shield is not aggression. It is architecture. It is the conscious creation of
                  protected space where transformation can occur undisturbed. Boseman knew: ideas are
                  fragile in the beginning. They need darkness to root. The drawer is not hiding ::
                  it is <em>housing</em>. The fortress is not fear :: it is <em>stewardship</em>.
                </p>

                  "Let it fester inside you" :: Active Patience
                </h3>
                <p className="text-stone-700">
                  Active Patience is not passive waiting. It is intentional incubation. The slow burn
                  that refines. The internal dialogue that deepens. Boseman let concepts "turn over in
                  the mind, expand, twist, deepen, and evolve." This is not delay :: it is <em>development</em>.
                  The stone is being forged in the fire of sustained attention.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-stone-700">
                  The overflowing is not random. It is the signal that the infrastructure is complete.
                  When trust has been built :: in the vision, in the timing, in yourself :: the work
                  can no longer be contained. This is not urgency born of anxiety. It is urgency born
                  of <em>readiness</em>. The future has become irresistible.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-stone-700">
                  The Conscious Forger knows: you do not simply <em>make</em> the work. The work <em>makes you</em>.
                  By the time you emerge, you are not the same person who began. This is the transformation
                  that distinguishes creation from production. The stone is forged, and so is the forger.

              Harris lit candles in a world that cursed the darkness.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Boseman built fortresses to protect the flame until it was strong enough to withstand
              the wind.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Both understood: transformation happens through practice, not performance.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">

            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Both created from a place of trust :: trust in the vision, trust in the process,
              trust that clarity, consistency, and coherence create conditions where the future
              becomes irresistible.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What would it mean to adopt Boseman's creative discipline within The Stone Forger's Way?
            </p>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-700">
              <p>
                <strong>1. Write it plain.</strong> Before you share, before you announce, before you
                seek validation :: write the vision for yourself. Make it concrete. Feel its weight.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Build the fortress.</strong> Not everything sacred should be spoken too soon.
                Protect the seed. Let it root in darkness. The Shield is an act of love, not fear.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Practice Active Patience.</strong> Let the work develop in you as you develop
                in it. Resist the culture of speed. Depth compounds. Trust the slow burn.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. Wait for the overflow.</strong> You will know when it's ready. Not when ego
                demands recognition, but when the work can no longer be contained. That urgency is the signal.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Let the work change you.</strong> If you emerge the same person who began,
                you may have produced something :: but you have not created. True creation is mutual transformation.
