  It reveals where we trust and where we doubt, 
                  where we flow and where we hoard, where we give freely and where we grasp tightly. The 
                  question is not whether to charge for our work :: the question is whether we can hold the 
                  paradox of giving freely while honoring conscious value exchange.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The False Binary</h2>
              
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  We have been taught to see money and generosity as opposites. Either you give it away for free 
                (and prove you're spiritual), or you charge for it (and prove you're greedy).
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  This is the 
                tyranny of the binary. This is the Stone Thrower's logic: if it costs money, it must be corrupt.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
                But what if money is simply energy? What if exchange is simply resonance? What if the act of 
                receiving payment is not extraction, but acknowledgment? Not taking, but allowing?
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  The Stone Forger does not hoard wealth. But neither do they give it away recklessly.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  They 
                understand that value exchange is part of the ecosystem. When someone pays for your work, they 
                are not being exploited :: they are participating in the Field.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  They are saying, "This resonates. I want to amplify this signal."
</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Hoarded Wealth</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  For years, I hoarded wealth. Not money :: insights.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  I carried notebooks full of revelations, hard 
                drives full of syntheses, conversations full of breakthroughs. And I kept them to myself.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  Why? 
                Because I didn't trust that they had value. Because I didn't trust that anyone would care.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  Because I didn't trust that I was allowed to share them.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  The hoarding was not humility. It was fear.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  It was the Stone Carrier's burden: "These stones 
                are too heavy to share. No one will understand.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  I must carry them alone."
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  But hoarded wealth does not serve the Field. It stagnates.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  It becomes dead weight. The only 
                way for wealth to flow is to release it.
</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Conscious Exchange</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  This website is an experiment in conscious value exchange. Everything here is free.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  You can 
                read every word, download every text, absorb every insight without paying a cent. This is not 
                a paywall.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  This is not a transaction.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  But if something resonates :: if a concept clicks, if a practice shifts something in you, if an 
                archetype helps you see yourself more clearly :: you are invited to contribute. Not because you 
                owe me.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  Not because I'm demanding payment. But because conscious value exchange is part of the 
                practice.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  When you pay for something that has value, you are not being exploited. You are participating 
                in the Field.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  You are saying, "I see this. I value this.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  I want this to continue existing."
</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Three Tiers</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
                The contribution structure on this site is not arbitrary. It is designed to honor different 
                levels of resonance:
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  <strong>$11 — The Acknowledgment.</strong> This says, "I see what you're doing. Thank you for 
                releasing this into the Field." It is the energetic equivalent of a nod.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  A recognition. A 
                simple exchange of resonance.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  <strong>$33 — The Amplification.</strong> This says, "This resonates deeply. I want to support 
                this work continuing." It is not just acknowledgment :: it is investment.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  It is the choice to 
                amplify the signal.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  <strong>$108 — The Sacred Number.</strong> In many spiritual traditions, 108 is a number of 
                completion. 108 beads on a mala. 108 sun salutations. 108 as the distance between the Earth 
                and the Sun in solar diameters. This contribution says, "This work has changed something 
                fundamental in me.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  I want to honor that."
</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif text-stone-800 mt-12 mb-6">The Practice</h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  Money as Teacher is a practice. It is the practice of noticing where you tighten around 
                exchange.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  Where you feel resentment when someone charges for their work. Where you feel guilt 
                when you charge for yours.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  Where you hoard because you don't trust the Field to provide.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  The Stone Forger does not hoard. The Stone Forger does not extract.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  The Stone Forger places 
                stones in the path and trusts that the Field will respond. Sometimes the response is financial.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
  Sometimes it is relational. Sometimes it is simply the deep knowing that the work is landing 
                where it needs to land.
</p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 mb-6">
                Trust the exchange. Trust the flow. Trust that when you give freely, the Field provides.
              </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 italic mb-0">
  "The hoarded wealth is not money. It is the insights we carry alone, the breakthroughs we 
                  keep to ourselves, the stepping stones we refuse to place in the path.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 italic mb-0">
  When we release them, 
                  we do not lose them. We multiply them."
