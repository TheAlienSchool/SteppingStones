  Samuel R. Harris was a research chemist who understood combustion, light, and energy

</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  When he chose to live by the principle "It is better to light

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  <strong>Raymond Howard Kemp</strong> (1907–2002) was a legend. Born in Cecil, Pennsylvania, 
                  he worked in the coal mines for a year before enrolling at Duquesne University, where he 
                  became an All-American football player.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  In 1933, he became one of the first Black players 
                  in the NFL, playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates (later the Steelers).
</p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  By 1937, Ray was the head coach of football, basketball, and track at Lincoln University 
                  in Jefferson City, Missouri. That summer, while vacationing at his family home near McDonald, 
                  Pennsylvania, Ray met Samuel R.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Harris.
</p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  After "a rather rough game of touch football," Ray offered Samuel an athletic scholarship 
                  to play football at Lincoln. This was the moment.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  The invisible bridge materialized beneath 
                  Samuel's feet. Ray Kemp saw something in Samuel that day :: potential, determination, 
                  intelligence :: and offered him a path out of the mines.
</p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                  Samuel accepted. He left the coal mines and went to college.

                  Ray Kemp's family home was at <strong>141 N McDonald Street</strong> in McDonald, Pennsylvania. 
                  This address was also the location of the <strong>First Baptist Church of McDonald</strong>, 
                  founded in 1848 and central to the Black community.

                  Decades later, Samuel's grandson <strong>Kamau Zuberi Akabueze</strong> (formerly Samuel Todd 
                  Harris) would attend church at this exact location with his grandmother <strong>Mabel Carter

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                  Kamau remembers family reunions near the church with his wonderful <strong>Aunt Grace</strong> (Mabel's sister) and <strong>Uncle Jerry</strong>. He remembers <strong>Aunt Janis</strong> as "the warm hug I needed growing up in a stone-faced world." The gift of Grace :: both the person and the quality :: woven into his childhood.

  Samuel graduated from Lincoln University in 1942 with a B.S. in Chemistry. He married 
                  <strong> Mabel Carter</strong> on August 4, 1942.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Mabel was from McDonald, Pennsylvania, 
                  and they had met in 1936 through church-oriented functions. Her family became "as brothers 
                  and sisters" to Samuel, creating the extended "Family of Friends."
</p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                  After serving in World War II, Samuel pursued graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh, 
                  earning his M.S. in Chemistry in 1948. During those years (1946–1948), Mabel was "wife, mother, 
                  and wage earner" while Samuel was "student and babysitter." Their partnership was the foundation.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  Samuel spent his career as a research chemist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines in Pittsburgh, 
                  conducting groundbreaking research on coal chemistry, mine safety, and environmental protection.
</p>
<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
  He was the only one in his high school class of 59 to earn a Master's Degree.

                  In 1969, he received the prestigious BCR Award for his contributions to coal research.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
  "It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness" was first written by 
                <strong> Reverend William L. Watkinson</strong> in 1907 in his sermon "The Invincible Strategy." 
                The sermon was reprinted in a missionary periodical called "China's Millions," which is why 
                the quote is often misattributed to Confucius or labeled a Chinese proverb.
</p>
<p className="text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
  Eleanor Roosevelt 
                became associated with it after Adlai Stevenson eulogized her in 1962, saying "she would rather 
                light a candle than curse the darkness, and her glow has warmed the world."
</p>
              <p className="text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
  Samuel R. Harris knew the true origin and chose to live by it anyway :: not because it was ancient 
                or exotic, but because it was true.
</p>
<p className="text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
  And he remixed it with his own wisdom about "the irresistible
