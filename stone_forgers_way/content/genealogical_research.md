# Genealogical Research: The Harris-Carter Lineage

### Lincoln University Career

- Served for twenty years, during which Lincoln University became a strong athletic powerhouse

**The Significance**: Ray Kemp's offer to Samuel R. Harris in 1937 was the pivotal moment that took Samuel from the coal mines to college, from coal loader to research chemist. Ray Kemp saw something in Samuel that day—potential, determination, intelligence—and offered him a path out. This is the invisible bridge, the stepping stone that materialized at exactly the right moment.

## The Carter Clan of McDonald, Pennsylvania

### First Baptist Church of McDonald
- Founded in 1848 (celebrating 125th anniversary in 2011, suggesting founding closer to 1886)
- Located on Washington Street, looking South from 3rd Street
- The original two-story frame structure was built in 1885
- Destroyed by fire in 1896 and rebuilt as a more modern brick church
- Central gathering place for the Black community in McDonald

### Mabel Carter Harris
- Born and raised in McDonald, Pennsylvania (approximately 9 miles from Muse)
- Member of First Baptist Church of McDonald
- Met Samuel R. Harris in 1936 through church-oriented functions
- Married Samuel on August 4, 1942
- During Samuel's graduate studies (1946-1948), Mabel was "wife, mother, and wage earner" while Samuel was "student and babysitter"
- Her family became "as brothers and sister" to Samuel, creating the extended "Family of Friends"

### The Coal Mining Context
- McDonald, Midway, and Muse were all coal mining communities in southwestern Pennsylvania
- African Americans migrated into the area after mines implemented an "open shop" policy around 1927
- Life was hard for coal miners' children during the Depression era
- The church was the social center, and "the only way to meet the nice girls of the town was through the Church"

## Historical Context: Black Families in Western Pennsylvania

### The Coal Industry & Migration
- African Americans were recruited to work in Pennsylvania coal mines, especially after 1927
- The 1925-1928 Western Pennsylvania Bituminous Coal Strike created labor tensions
- Black miners often faced discrimination but also found opportunities
- Communities like McDonald, Canonsburg, Muse, and Benwood had small but resilient Black populations

### The Significance of Education
- For Black families in coal mining communities, education was the path out
- Very few children of coal miners went to college
- Samuel R. Harris was the only one in his high school class of 59 to earn a Master's Degree
- The fact that Ray Kemp (who also worked in the mines before college) recognized this path and offered it to Samuel is profound

## The Names: Terma in Action

**Samuel Todd Harris** → **Kamau Zuberi Akabueze**

- **Kamau**: Swahili/Kikuyu origin, meaning "Quiet Warrior"
- **Zuberi**: Swahili origin, meaning "Strong" or "Good"
- **Akabueze**: Igbo origin (Nigeria), meaning "Word is Supreme" or "The word of the king"

### Ancestry Composition (from genetic testing)
- 77.5% Sub-Saharan African
  - 71.8% West African
  - 53.2% Nigerian
  - 5.8% Senegambian & Guinean
  - 4.3% Ghanaian, Liberian & Sierra Leonean
  - 8.5% Broadly West African
  - 5.0% Congolese & Southern East African

**The Terma**: Kamau chose these names in the mid-1990s because they "spoke to him." He learned later that they are from the region of his birth—his ancestral homeland. He didn't learn something new. He remembered what was always hidden within. The names found him because they were always his.

## The Lineage of Light

Samuel R. Harris's philosophy: "It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness."

The lineage continues. The candle burns. The stones are forged.
